			<h5>ATTITUDE</h5>
			<p>I'm a generalist, familiar with many technologies. <br/>
			If I don't know how to do something, I enjoy (quickly) learning how to do it.<br/>
			I understand that the best programmers are constantly practicing, improving, 
			and sharpening their skills. </p>

			<h5>CLEAN CODE</h5>
			<p>I'm passionate about learning how to craft clean, elegant code.<br/>
			I'm reading books like 
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">
			Clean Code</a> and 
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">
			The Pragmatic Programmer</a> to try to develop this skill - It's common for me 
			to look at code I wrote a year ago and cringe, 
			thinking: "I would do that so differently now".</p>

			<h5>TECHNOLOGIES</h5>
			<p>I prefer working in a Unix-based environment using expressive languages 
			like Ruby and Python with Git for version control, although I also have experience
			developing in Windows with C# and .NET using Visual Studio.<br/>
			I have decent experience with web development (Rails, JS/CSS/HTML).<br/>
			I first learned programming in Java, so I'm comfortable with it.<br/>
			I'd be open to learning Scala, it appeals to me.</p>
