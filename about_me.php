			<h5>ATTITUDE</h5>
			<p>I'm a generalist, familiar with many technologies. If I don't know how to do something, 
			I enjoy quickly learning how to do it. I understand that the best programmers are constantly 
			practicing, improving, and sharpening their skills. <br/>
			I completed the Stanford Startup Engineering MOOC in September 2013.<br/>
