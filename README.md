**This is the old version of my personal site. In September 2014 I switched to the [updated version](https://github.com/thearrow/personal-site) built with middleman.**

- My personal site, created to host my resume and info about my projects.

- Ultra-simple, runs nginx on heroku serving static html/css.

- Styles in scss, compiled to app.css. Header background is a photo I took in Wyoming on my roadtrip of summer 2012.

- For local dev, start nginx and php-fpm: `sudo nginx && php-fpm`
